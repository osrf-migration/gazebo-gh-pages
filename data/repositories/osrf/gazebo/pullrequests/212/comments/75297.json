A couple comments:\n\n1. If your cursor is not pointing at an object when you click (ie. pointing at the sky or past the edge of the ground plane when zoomed out very far), then the orbit doesn't attach to an object and panning and zooming are really slow. Rotate seems to work with the center at the current camera position, so that no camera translation occurs, which I find pretty useful. Wouldn't mind a keyboard shortcut for that behavior (Shift + Center click drag or something).\n\n2. The camera behavior is different when the rotate / move tools are selected. It basically locks the previous orb location in place until you return to the Selection tool. This also resembles an accidental feature, in case people wanted the orb location to hold still across a couple of click+drags, though I'm not sure how useful that feature is.\n\n3. Sometimes I like to adjust the camera to get a top-down view of the world. This used to work, though there was a little bit of weird camera rotation because of the singularity in yaw-pitch-roll rotations when pitch = +- 90 degrees. With this pull request, however, it lets you rotate past the singularity so that the camera is upside down, which is kind of awesome, though I suspect it's unintended. I can supply a video if people are having trouble reproducing this. Maybe we should limit the maximum pitch angles to +-89 degrees or something like that?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I agree with Thomas that it does work much better now.
