The difference is that it is not added to the `WorldPrivate::models` list in the `World::LoadActor() `method, as it is done in `World::LoadModel()` for the \"normal\" models.\r\n\r\nOften this would actually go unnoticed because in many places, it is not the `models` vector which is used to iterate through the models, but instead the general element pointers, in this form:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n  // Load the plugins for all the models                                        \r\n  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < this->dataPtr->rootElement->GetChildCount(); ++i)\r\n  {                                                                             \r\n    if (this->dataPtr->rootElement->GetChild(i)->HasType(Base::MODEL))          \r\n    {\r\n       ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Actor` models are caught with this. Crucially, this approach is also used for `World::BuildSceneMsg`, so that when a new gzclient connects to the world, it will get the model, and everything will run nicely.\r\n\r\nHowever the actors are not returned with `World::Models()`. So if we're using `World`  interface directly (not via messages connection like gzclient), then we miss out on the `Actor` models.\r\n\r\nIs there any particular reason this was done like this for the actors?  \r\nIf not, I suggest treating them as the models and adding the changes of this PR to make the behaviour of `World::LoadActor()` the same as `World::LoadModel()`.\r\n\r\nBy the way: The `Road` is treated as entity only as well, and not registered separately in a similar fashion (see `World::LoadRoad`). But this would have to be treated separately because it's not technically a model (or should it be?). It would be nice to have a method which returns all entities which are no model then, e.g. `Entity_M World::Entities().` It would be good to have a getter which allows to get *all* the objects in the world incl. roads (lights could still be treated separately as it is).\r\n\r\nWhat's your thoughts on this?", "title": "Added actors in World as models so they get returned with Models()", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "cd526975bc8b", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/commit/cd526975bc8b.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/commits/cd526975bc8b"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}ts=1694483"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "osrf/gazebo", "uuid": "{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "611ea2a06834", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/JenniferBuehler/gazebo/commit/611ea2a06834"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/JenniferBuehler/gazebo/commits/611ea2a06834"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/JenniferBuehler/gazebo"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/JenniferBuehler/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{11522dd5-648b-4e9e-b908-d3e1170ba728}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "JenniferBuehler/gazebo", "uuid": "{11522dd5-648b-4e9e-b908-d3e1170ba728}"}, "branch": {"name": "actor_loaded_as_model"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Jennifer Buehler", "uuid": "{5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28ae0e95eada6ee16f0860c1fa59fdcd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsJB-4.png"}}, "nickname": "JenniferBuehler", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:96bd489a-ec14-4a06-8d31-7bb6d46d1209"}, "date": "2017-03-18T04:02:28.030246+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2661, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2661.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2661"}}, "title": "Added actors in World as models so they get returned with Models()"}}]}
