For example, if I'm rotating the model, the interactive marker also rotates. However, when we are in scale mode, the interactive marker does not change while I'm scaling the object pulling from one of the axes. I would expect the same behavior as with the other two modes.\n\n* The other issue is also related with the interactive marker but this time after releasing the button. The model is always scaled but the interactive marker is not always scaled in the same proportion. Try inserting a box, enlarge it, and then, reduce its size to its original dimension to see this effect. You'll notice that the interactive marker does not have the original size.\n\nWe can tackle these points as a separate issue from the pull request if you believe it's better.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I've observed two issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>While using the translation/rotation mode, the interactive marker moves following the operation that the user is doing.
