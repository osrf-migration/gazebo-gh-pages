I think the implementation is not important as long as we get the desired behaviour.

I think the most important thing is to have a useful tool with a clear expected behaviour.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but after looking at the 2 pull requests I think the desired specs would be:\n\n* `Right click a model  -> Follow` - the camera starts following the model with the default distance and orientation.\n\n* `Right click a link -> Follow` is also possible\n\n* It is possible to specify a model/link/visual (name) from the SDF to track from startup.\n\n* No matter how the tracking was triggered, it should be possible to configure parameters on the left panel (under GUI->camera?) and changes are observed in real time\n\n* It's also possible to specify other follow configurations on SDF without setting a specific entity to be tracked. In that case, when follow mode is triggered with right-click, those parameters are used unless they've been changed in the GUI.
