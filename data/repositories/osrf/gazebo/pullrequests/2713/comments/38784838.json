Internally it is fine because of the `ShapeNode::setRelativeTransform` which you mentioned (see also my last post, same as for bullet).

I think `Model::BoundingBox()` is not needed at crucial places, at least it isn't needed for the underlying simulation (in dart or bullet). That's why it may not have been noticed before.
