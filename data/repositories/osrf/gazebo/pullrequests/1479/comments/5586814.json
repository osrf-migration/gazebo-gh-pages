This section is running a parameterized test (all physics engines) and trying to test a change that will only be affected in ODE (since the other physics engines don't have `contact_max_correcting_vel` as a parameter). It looks like this part of the test is redundant with the section above it. I'm not really sure what to do though, so I'm just going to add a conditional to only expect the `SetParam` to return true if the physics engine is ODE. ~~Test should pass in 5f8988c.~~ just kidding, I need to change the `contact_sensor` test too. The `SetParam` calls there for physics engine parameters have a similar lack of effect on the test.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for bringing my attention to this section of code.
