I actually set the background to green (0 1 0 0) so that I can segment the object easily afterwards. My problem is that pixels in the edges of the object become someway interpolated with the background and therefore turn greenish (a color which was chosen precisely because it is not in the model). Would it be possible to render in a way so that pixels corresponding to the object are not affected by the background? I am providing a sample image. Thank you!\n\n ![image.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/88506700-image.png)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for helping.
