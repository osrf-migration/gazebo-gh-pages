Basically, this modification is related to the removal of `#include <OGRE/OgreWindowEventUtilities.h>` at line 34. That file has been moved to another location in Ogre 1.11, so including it from there would create a build error. Fortunately that header is not used in the Gazebo codebase, so we can avoid including it at all for OGRE\\_VERSION\\_MINOR >= 11 . However, given that `ogre_gazebo.h` is part of the public Gazebo headers, for Gazebo 10 compile with Ogre <= 1.10, we want to continue to include the header, to avoid breaking the build of any downstream project that uses the definitions coming from `#include <OGRE/OgreWindowEventUtilities.h>` via the inclusion of Gazebo headers.
