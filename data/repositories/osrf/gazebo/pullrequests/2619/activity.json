However, if Gazebo is switching unconditionally to Qt5 for this release, I'd recommend changing `SearchForStuff.cmake` to only use qwt-qt5.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is only Ubuntu-related, and the name `qwt` is used on other platforms.  In that case it would be nice to detect somehow if the selected library is Qt4 or Qt5, because the condition where the program simply crashes before `main()` is very hard to understand.  It occurs for any program that links both libQt5Gui.so and libQtGui.so, which happens in gzclient if libqwt is selected instead of libqwt-qt5.", "title": "Remove plain 'qwt' leaving only 'qwt-qt5', since it links to Qt4 version.", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "8d35d7d913a3", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/commit/8d35d7d913a3.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/commits/8d35d7d913a3"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}ts=1694483"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "osrf/gazebo", "uuid": "{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "84632a1a6398", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/radarsat1/gazebo/commit/84632a1a6398"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/radarsat1/gazebo/commits/84632a1a6398"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/radarsat1/gazebo"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/radarsat1/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{7d46b7e6-3f98-4e7d-a49d-f4fd60e8b76f}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "radarsat1/gazebo", "uuid": "{7d46b7e6-3f98-4e7d-a49d-f4fd60e8b76f}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Stephen Sinclair", "uuid": "{fdfe8af1-20be-4213-929c-76ca03a98c9e}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bfdfe8af1-20be-4213-929c-76ca03a98c9e%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Bfdfe8af1-20be-4213-929c-76ca03a98c9e%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c7c3cf7a6e43916a9c03ffdd1d77e58d=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSS-0.png"}}, "nickname": "radarsat1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:09fe48b3-cecf-4ae6-a621-12965234c939"}, "date": "2017-01-24T17:55:38.514141+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2619, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2619.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2619"}}, "title": "Remove plain 'qwt' leaving only 'qwt-qt5', since it links to Qt4 version."}}]}
