This will allow much more interesting animations in Gazebo now :smile:\n\n![traffic3.gif](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/1776597282-traffic3.gif)\n\nI did notice one problem though. When I run `worlds/actor.world`, the actor is walking inside the ground. When I run `worlds/cafe.world` though, the actors look ok. The main difference between these worlds is that the former uses an SDF script tag while the latter uses a plugin. I suspect this pull request may be fixing a problem with the script, which is being compensated for on the world, so we may need to change the world. I haven't looked closely at the code yet though.\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Than you for the pull request!
