Maybe leave it at the original pose but move the camera there?\n\nHowever, I can think of a case when the user carefully placed a lot of models, then tries to edit one of them and it moves to the pose it was originally placed at, and it ends up on top of something else making it difficult to edit...\n\nAnother idea is to have a button just to make the model upright at the current position...
