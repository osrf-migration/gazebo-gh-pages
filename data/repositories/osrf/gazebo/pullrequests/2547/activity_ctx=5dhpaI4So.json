One may stumble over this one at first and think that it may have to do with it, and maybe it has now in DART 6, but it's been in the DART 5 Gazebo bindings and wasn't causing the same test failures there. I've left it in there for now. I've just capped it to positive values as I was getting error messages about the friction coefficient not being allowed to be negative.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2016-12-20T21:40:14.685963+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Jennifer Buehler", "uuid": "{5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B5949baad-8c43-4d52-9a82-bb8c3511fed8%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b28ae0e95eada6ee16f0860c1fa59fdcd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsJB-4.png"}}, "nickname": "JenniferBuehler", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:96bd489a-ec14-4a06-8d31-7bb6d46d1209"}, "updated_on": "2016-12-20T21:40:14.750988+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 28664371}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2547, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547"}}, "title": "Dart 6"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547/comments/28662723.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547/_/diff#comment-28662723"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2547, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547"}}, "title": "Dart 6"}, "content": {"raw": "here's the most recent jenkins build with dart6 built from source:\n\n* http://build.osrfoundation.org/job/gazebo-any_dart4-devel-trusty-amd64-gpu-nvidia_docker/43/", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>here's the most recent jenkins build with dart6 built from source:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://build.osrfoundation.org/job/gazebo-any_dart4-devel-trusty-amd64-gpu-nvidia_docker/43/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ap-connect-link\">http://build.osrfoundation.org/job/gazebo-any_dart4-devel-trusty-amd64-gpu-nvidia_docker/43/</a></li>\n</ul>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2016-12-20T21:03:27.671024+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "updated_on": "2016-12-20T21:03:27.678743+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 28662723}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2547, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547"}}, "title": "Dart 6"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547/comments/28661703.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547/_/diff#comment-28661703"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2547, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547"}}, "title": "Dart 6"}, "content": {"raw": "cc: @jlee02 ", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>cc: @jlee02 </p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2016-12-20T20:41:17.448863+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Steve Peters", "uuid": "{2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B2ccfed09-18b8-4921-8d58-15ef01092802%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fb4816dad9e68337d3096f750951f6cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsSP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "Steven Peters", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:5de38267-b118-494c-aa76-4fab35448816"}, "updated_on": "2016-12-20T20:41:17.455148+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 28661703}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2547, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2547.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2547"}}, "title": "Dart 6"}}, {"update": {"description": "Changes required to run Gazebo with DART 6.\r\n\r\nThere are still 3 test failures related to DART which may need to be addressed or skipped for DART.
