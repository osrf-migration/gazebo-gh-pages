It also provide a fix for issue 396: the building editor creates a folder with model.config and model.sdf files for a saved model, adds it to the model path, and notifies the InsertModelWidget to make the model is available in the \"Insert Model\" tab.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: There are a few known issues that I am leaving for future work:\r\n\r\n1. On some computers, saving a model to the home folder causes Gazebo to crash. This happens if the hidden folder ~/.dbus is owned by root. If instructed to write to the home folder, the program will first attempt to write to .dbus, which will lead to a permission denied exception. This could be fixed by adding a try/catch block around the write, but this still does not allow the user to write models to the home folder. Suggestions for a complete fix are welcome.\r\n\r\n2.
