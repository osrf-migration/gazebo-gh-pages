This should give the help output for the sub-command.\n\n* The `gz camera` command requires a camera name, but it's not very obvious how to figure out a camera name (my guess is to grep for camera in `gztopic list` or `gz topic -l`). When complaining that no camera names were given, it should provide a list of names to choose from.\n\n* If you have multiple gzclient windows open, I only saw one topic for `gzclient_camera`, so each gzclient camera instance can't be commanded individually.
