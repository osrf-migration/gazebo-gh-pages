The `geometry.proto` message is changing the polyline from `optional` to `repeated`. Since the `polyline.proto` message declares both `height` and `vertices` fields, this means that a polyline message will have multiple height values specified. Also the `polyline.world` has multiple `polyline` geometry elements.\n\nThe `PolylineShape` API's are changing to allow multiple sets of vertices, but not multiple height values. Do we need multiple height values?\n\nAlso, how are multiple sets of vertices interpreted? Is the first always a solid shape and any following sets of vertices will subtract? This should be clarified in the documentation.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I have a question about the change in the polyline data structure.
