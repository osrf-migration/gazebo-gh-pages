I'm sorry that it's taken so long to get some feedback from any of your assigned reviewers. I'm sure, like me, the others are plagued by work right now. To be frank, it's been a while since I worked with Gazebo and I'd need to check-out the repo again to test the fix, which might take a while. @nkoenig or @scpeters are probably better folk to action this review.\n\nWhile we're modifying the ```Apply``` method, we should have a high-level brainstorm think as to whether we should also consider spatially-correlated error. For example, in WiFi localization RSSI and ToF are perturbed by environmental clutter. The problem is similar for GNSS, temperature, etc. I'm not suggesting that we add a distribution that accounts for spatially-correlated noise, but merely that the NoisePlugin could have access to the current position of the sensing element (phase center of antenna, temperature sensor). \n\nIt would only really make sense to pass in an absolute position, not delta position to make this happen. Should we not also consider passing a global time rather than delta time, and have the noise model track the delta internally?\n\nI apologize that these thoughts aren't very specific right now. It;s been a while since I've thought about this!\n\nAndrew\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi @jgoppert </p>\n<p>Firstly, this looks like a really impressive effort and I agree with the general approach you have taken (passing a measurement of elapsed time into the <code>Apply</code> method was the approach I took when I started working on this issue a year or two ago).
