I agree that it would be beneficial if noise models had access to more data. One thing limiting this is that the wind plugin is now using the noise as well. For the wind plugin there is no sensor or position that could be passed in. So we would have to be able to handle that edge case. My first inclination was to pass the sensor pointer to the noise ctor, but this stopped me from doing that. Any thoughts on how to get around this?\n\nAnother case related to your suggestions is table/polynomial based bias. I have an application where I have a mapped a magnetic field indoors and would like to use my polynomial, heading(X, Y, Z) model for magnetometer bias. I'm not sure if this fits here but I would like to think about how to plug it in long term.\n\nRegarding absolute time vs time delta, I think it would be more flexible if we passed absolute time in. It is a bit more information the user could use for the noise model. They could have t as well as dt at their disposal.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>@asymingt Thanks for the input.
