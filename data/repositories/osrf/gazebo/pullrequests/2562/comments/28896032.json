I  only tested it with the sphere spawn button in the tutorials and it works.\nOne test could be to load up a dummy GUI plugin which sets a static boolean in its constructor, which the test code could then check for being set to true. Maybe not the best idea but can't think of anything better right now...\n\nOn another note, I made a different version in which the plugin gets loaded onto the RenderWidget instead of the MainWindow. I find that nicer because there is usually more space on it and it doesn't get pasted above the top-left info window. I also saw that this is where the plugins specified in the INI file get loaded to. On the other hand, it's also more restrictive to put it on the RenderWidget... what do you reckon? If you also prefer the RenderWidget solution I can update the PR with this.\n\nCheers\nJenny", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Louise,</p>\n<p>Thanks for reviewing this.</p>\n<p>I got rid of the warning, always forget about the style check ;)</p>\n<p>I have seen the test failures before in my dart-6 branch, I highly doubt they are related to the changes in this PR because the code only ever gets used if there are -g command line arguments...</p>\n<p>True, making a test for this would be nice, on the other hand it's really such a minor change that I'm thinking the best test is probably to just bring up a GUI plugin with gzclient and see that it works ;) Because I presume the GUI Plugins have their own proper tests already?\nOn the other hand, that's not automated testing for the future...
