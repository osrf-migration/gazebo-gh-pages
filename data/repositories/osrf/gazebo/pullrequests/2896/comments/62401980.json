I think there's two options:\n\n1. Add a `Fini` function that resets the `ConnectionPtr` and `SubscriberPtr` first of all so that there won't be any further callbacks, then calls `node->Fini()`, clears `PublisherPtr`s and the `WorldPtr`. I think that might be enough.\n\n2. Use a weak world pointer, and re-order the private data class so that the `ConnectionPtr` and `SubscriberPtr` are at the bottom of the list so that they are destructed first.
