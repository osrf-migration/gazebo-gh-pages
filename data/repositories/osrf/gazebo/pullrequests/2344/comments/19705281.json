You're correct we need to update zmq cppzmq stuff, but I prefer to use the `FindZeroMQ.cmake` used in `ign-transport`. That way we only need to set `ZeroMQ_ROOT_DIR`.\n\n 1. There are lots of additions to LINK_DIRECTORIES and INCLUDE_DIRECTORES, and I guess I'm wondering how these are currently working on linux? We want consistent behavior. So if they work on linux for some good reason, maybe we should condition their addition with an ifdef on windows.\n\nI will surely have more comments as I continue to look through this. Thanks for the contribution though.
