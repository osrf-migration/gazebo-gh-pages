To fully appreciate it, load the world with the default branch, and view Transparent and Contacts (or look at the following comparison videos). The test world has a pair of boxes on the ground and a pair of spheres resting on a group of large static spheres. One of each pair has the default `min_depth`, `max_vel` parameters, and the other has `min_depth` = 1cm, `max_vel` = 0. In each pair, the object with the default parameters has more jumpy contacts. This pull request greatly improves the stability of the contact forces in both cases.\n\n![contact stability world](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/96660379/contact_stability.jpg)\n\n[Video of Contact Stability before pull request #494](https://vimeo.com/65182562)\n\n[Video of Contact Stability after pull request #494](https://vimeo.com/65164275)\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>John didn't mention it, but I will: this pull request greatly improves the stability of contact forces in <code>test/worlds/contact_stability.world</code>.
