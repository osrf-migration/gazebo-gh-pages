The other option would be to create extra `DARTLink` and `DARTJoint` objects that correspond to the split `dart::dynamics::BodyNode` and `dart::dynamics::Joint` objects, but this would create a discrepancy between the Gazebo representation of the model and the SDF representation of the model, which is likely to cause problems for end-users. Consequently, I think this \"slave link\" approach is the best solution, despite my concerns.\n\nThis implementation of the slave links looks very good. I think I'll be happy to approve it after we run a build test with the latest changes.\n\nBeing able to support closed-loop kinematics with DART has been in demand for a very long time, so I'm grateful that it's finally been done.
