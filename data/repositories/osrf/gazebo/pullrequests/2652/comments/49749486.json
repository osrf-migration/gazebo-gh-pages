Could you share your world files? Nevertheless, it seems it makes sense to flip some vectors if the order of the bodies changes. However, it seems to me it'd be more proper the negate the contact normal, which would then affect more parts of the code that also access the contact normal data...\n\nAnd regarding the second one - I can't replicate the behavior you describe. I tried it both in [Gazebo 7](https://vimeo.com/243098476) and [Gazebo 8](https://vimeo.com/243098480), and the problem doesn't manifest. Is the weight and inertia of your robot correct? Mine weighs about 20 kg, which adds a lot of stability.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi @Flipse789 , good to hear you more or less successfully use this plugin.</p>\n<p>Regarding the first bug: it seems I can't get to a case where the swap would trigger in my scenarios.
