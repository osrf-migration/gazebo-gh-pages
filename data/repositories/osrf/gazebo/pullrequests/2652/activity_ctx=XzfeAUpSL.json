I modified the plugin, so that the variable \"tracks\" of SimpleTrackedVehiclePlugin can now store 6, instead of 2 LinkPtr's. Also BELT_CATEGORY, ROBOT_CATEGORY and, on the left side, LEFT_CATEGORY will be set on the flippers. Everything works on simple surfaces, but i found some bugs:\n\nIf the robot is driving/rotating e.g. on ramps, std::swap() (used in SimpleTrackedVehiclePlugin::DriveTracks) will be triggered. This causes the friction direction to point in the opposite direction. I have fixed this by setting beltDirection to -beltDirection, if std::swap has been used before. You can see the bug in the following video. The result of frictionDirection will be displayed as markers in rviz, with the length of the calculated value of motion1.

You can see this in this video (the first bug is already fixed in this video, that's why the robot can now rotate on the ramp): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPy5BFjr4g4\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ap-connect-link\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPy5BFjr4g4</a></p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2017-11-15T19:11:36.197020+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Philip", "uuid": "{9698d1a6-994f-4bd0-ac88-485da498f1e3}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B9698d1a6-994f-4bd0-ac88-485da498f1e3%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B9698d1a6-994f-4bd0-ac88-485da498f1e3%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eff00867f81bd0897d79525a81bc0348d=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsP-2.png"}}, "nickname": "Flipse789", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:abcc4a84-8ee8-413a-adc6-e6c8553b65e1"}, "updated_on": "2017-11-15T19:45:44.056854+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 49683213}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/47046109.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-47046109"}}, "parent": {"id": 46657924, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46657924.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46657924"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}, "content": {"raw": "Have you tried the new version?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Have you tried the new version?</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2017-10-12T15:45:12.210140+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Martin Pecka", "uuid": "{41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1ad32a09564f856909994613fdbc37cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsMP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "peci1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:434ecab2-e510-4ede-8f9a-1c2a5a4032e1"}, "updated_on": "2017-10-12T15:45:12.248793+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 47046109}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46978009.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46978009"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}, "content": {"raw": "It'd also be nice to cherry-pick pull request #2702 here, so that the wheeled model works a bit better.

{"update": {"description": "* Added the base for tracked vehicles.\r\n\r\n* Added the simple tracked vehicle utilizing Contact Surface Motion method of track simulation.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna publish a paper at IROS 2017 about this method, so I wanted to share it to the community. \r\n\r\nThis is just a first shot at the API. I'll welcome any comments. What I'm most unsure about is:\r\n\r\n* I wanted to create a common interface all tracked vehicle plugins could use. However, I had some problems with linking or dynamic loading when I just dynamically linked the \"bottom\" plugin against the API plugin. Some discussion about rpath has already been there, and the agreement was that for plugins it's gonna stay there. But I'm not sure if it is expected to work \"inside\" Gazebo, or only for external code. For now, I'm building the API library statically, which I know is not ideal, but is the only thing that worked for me.\r\n* Is gazebo8 the right target? I didn't change anything outside the plugins dir (+ changelog and worlds).\r\n* I resorted to writing my own SDF parameter loading helpers, because the way they are read in other plugins seems really cumbersome to me (bascially copy&paste 10 lines of code for each parameter). Shouldn't that code be moved somewhere \"higher\" in the class hierarchy?\r\n* Is there no 3-valued `signum` function available in standard C/C++ library or ignition?\r\n* Should the example model and obstacle be in this repo, or should they be moved to the OSRF model library?\r\n\r\nIf I'll find more time, I'll add the other models suggested in #!/osrf/gazebo/issues/863/tracksdriveplugin (I already have the implementations, but they need some cleanup). One thing that really stopped me for a long while was programmatic building of the model (generating the track pieces). I ended up writing SDF in C strings and calling `Link::Load()` or `Joint::Load()`. And removing links/joints seems to be even bigger pain in *** . Is there some tutorial on programmatic building/destroying of the world? There also seems to be a (possibly unresolvable) problem that in SDF you can't specify a link connected to a joint that will be auto-generated by a plugin.", "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "3dab9ef73ad0", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/commit/3dab9ef73ad0.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/commits/3dab9ef73ad0"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}ts=1694483"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "osrf/gazebo", "uuid": "{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}"}, "branch": {"name": "gazebo9"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "1ab285a57d0a", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo/commit/1ab285a57d0a"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo/commits/1ab285a57d0a"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "peci1/gazebo", "uuid": "{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}"}, "branch": {"name": "tracked_vehicles"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Martin Pecka", "uuid": "{41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1ad32a09564f856909994613fdbc37cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsMP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "peci1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:434ecab2-e510-4ede-8f9a-1c2a5a4032e1"}, "date": "2017-10-11T21:53:30.692593+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46969857.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46969857"}}, "parent": {"id": 46958685, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46958685.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46958685"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}, "content": {"raw": "Hmm, few surprises showed up... boost dropped implicit conversion of optional<> to bool in 1.56...

I'll welcome any comments. What I'm most unsure about is:\r\n\r\n* I wanted to create a common interface all tracked vehicle plugins could use. However, I had some problems with linking or dynamic loading when I just dynamically linked the \"bottom\" plugin against the API plugin. Some discussion about rpath has already been there, and the agreement was that for plugins it's gonna stay there. But I'm not sure if it is expected to work \"inside\" Gazebo, or only for external code. For now, I'm building the API library statically, which I know is not ideal, but is the only thing that worked for me.\r\n* Is gazebo8 the right target? I didn't change anything outside the plugins dir (+ changelog and worlds).\r\n* I resorted to writing my own SDF parameter loading helpers, because the way they are read in other plugins seems really cumbersome to me (bascially copy&paste 10 lines of code for each parameter). Shouldn't that code be moved somewhere \"higher\" in the class hierarchy?\r\n* Is there no 3-valued `signum` function available in standard C/C++ library or ignition?\r\n* Should the example model and obstacle be in this repo, or should they be moved to the OSRF model library?\r\n\r\nIf I'll find more time, I'll add the other models suggested in #!/osrf/gazebo/issues/863/tracksdriveplugin (I already have the implementations, but they need some cleanup). One thing that really stopped me for a long while was programmatic building of the model (generating the track pieces). I ended up writing SDF in C strings and calling `Link::Load()` or `Joint::Load()`. And removing links/joints seems to be even bigger pain in *** . Is there some tutorial on programmatic building/destroying of the world? There also seems to be a (possibly unresolvable) problem that in SDF you can't specify a link connected to a joint that will be auto-generated by a plugin.", "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "3dab9ef73ad0", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/commit/3dab9ef73ad0.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/commits/3dab9ef73ad0"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}ts=1694483"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "osrf/gazebo", "uuid": "{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}"}, "branch": {"name": "gazebo9"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "334996de1242", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo/commit/334996de1242"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo/commits/334996de1242"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "peci1/gazebo", "uuid": "{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}"}, "branch": {"name": "tracked_vehicles"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Martin Pecka", "uuid": "{41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1ad32a09564f856909994613fdbc37cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsMP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "peci1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:434ecab2-e510-4ede-8f9a-1c2a5a4032e1"}, "date": "2017-10-11T17:51:08.086260+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46657924.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46657924"}}, "parent": {"id": 46653954, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/46653954.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-46653954"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}, "content": {"raw": "Hi Martin,\n\nthank you for the answer.

I'll welcome any comments. What I'm most unsure about is:\r\n\r\n* I wanted to create a common interface all tracked vehicle plugins could use. However, I had some problems with linking or dynamic loading when I just dynamically linked the \"bottom\" plugin against the API plugin. Some discussion about rpath has already been there, and the agreement was that for plugins it's gonna stay there. But I'm not sure if it is expected to work \"inside\" Gazebo, or only for external code. For now, I'm building the API library statically, which I know is not ideal, but is the only thing that worked for me.\r\n* Is gazebo8 the right target? I didn't change anything outside the plugins dir (+ changelog and worlds).\r\n* I resorted to writing my own SDF parameter loading helpers, because the way they are read in other plugins seems really cumbersome to me (bascially copy&paste 10 lines of code for each parameter). Shouldn't that code be moved somewhere \"higher\" in the class hierarchy?\r\n* Is there no 3-valued `signum` function available in standard C/C++ library or ignition?\r\n* Should the example model and obstacle be in this repo, or should they be moved to the OSRF model library?\r\n\r\nIf I'll find more time, I'll add the other models suggested in #!/osrf/gazebo/issues/863/tracksdriveplugin (I already have the implementations, but they need some cleanup). One thing that really stopped me for a long while was programmatic building of the model (generating the track pieces). I ended up writing SDF in C strings and calling `Link::Load()` or `Joint::Load()`. And removing links/joints seems to be even bigger pain in *** . Is there some tutorial on programmatic building/destroying of the world? There also seems to be a (possibly unresolvable) problem that in SDF you can't specify a link connected to a joint that will be auto-generated by a plugin.", "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "36068ba1bbcb", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/commit/36068ba1bbcb.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/commits/36068ba1bbcb"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}ts=1694483"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "osrf/gazebo", "uuid": "{51a0cd5d-8697-4eb1-8b08-e919ee881e1c}"}, "branch": {"name": "gazebo9"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "6d3ecd0cedef", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo/commit/6d3ecd0cedef"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo/commits/6d3ecd0cedef"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/peci1/gazebo"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/peci1/gazebo"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}ts=c_plus_plus"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "gazebo", "full_name": "peci1/gazebo", "uuid": "{5c0265bf-91e2-463c-bbb1-7fa554f310a0}"}, "branch": {"name": "tracked_vehicles"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Martin Pecka", "uuid": "{41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1ad32a09564f856909994613fdbc37cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsMP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "peci1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:434ecab2-e510-4ede-8f9a-1c2a5a4032e1"}, "date": "2017-03-24T13:34:46.842386+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/33776144.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-33776144"}}, "parent": {"id": 33775862, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/comments/33775862.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652/_/diff#comment-33775862"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}, "content": {"raw": "I'm sorry, that's probably a refactoring relict that didn't show at my build because I didn't do a clean build, so the symbol was apparently somehow left around.\n\nTry this instead of line 67: `GZ_ASSERT(jointNames.size() >= 2`", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I'm sorry, that's probably a refactoring relict that didn't show at my build because I didn't do a clean build, so the symbol was apparently somehow left around.</p>\n<p>Try this instead of line 67: <code>GZ_ASSERT(jointNames.size() &gt;= 2</code></p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2017-03-24T00:35:45.767033+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Martin Pecka", "uuid": "{41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B41691c43-4ae0-49ba-ba45-3c36439f5af2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1ad32a09564f856909994613fdbc37cd=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsMP-1.png"}}, "nickname": "peci1", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:434ecab2-e510-4ede-8f9a-1c2a5a4032e1"}, "inline": {}, "updated_on": "2017-03-24T00:35:45.819061+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 33776144}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 2652, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/2652"}}, "title": "Added support for tracked vehicles"}}], "next": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/2652/activity_ctx=onhMXsgUz.json"}
