My particular use case is to:\r\n\r\n* Load a Gazebo world with `<road>` elements\r\n* Spawn a car model with a front-facing camera to simulate in ROS\r\n* Process the camera image output to simulate lane detection\r\n\r\nI had the same problem as shown in the above referenced issue and question where the road textures did not appear in the camera image output.\r\n\r\nI found the root cause of this issue. Before this PR, when the `World` class parses a world file with `<road>` elements, it sends Gazebo `Road` messages before any models are loaded and ready to receive them. This causes models with camera sensors to miss the road messages, which makes the roads invisible in the camera image output.\r\n\r\nThe workaround re-transmits the `Road` messages at the first physics update and whenever a new model is loaded. This way, everything that needs to know about the road segments won't miss the messages.\r\n\r\nThis workaround seems inelegant, but it definitely solved my problem and I think will solve the problem in the above referenced question.

This would explain the phenomenon reported in the <a data-is-external-link=\"true\" href=\"http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/12553/road-visuals-not-shown-in-published-camera-image/?answer=20509#post-id-20509\" rel=\"nofollow\">answer</a> to the gazebosim.org question on this issue. From my ignorance of the underlying messaging layer, this seems to indicate there is a latched message buffer of size 1. If I\u2019m correct in this assumption, perhaps the buffer size could be increased to support a reasonable number of roads in a world?</p>\n<p>\u200c</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2020-01-14T02:38:17.130157+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Micho Radovnikovich", "uuid": "{a0c412bd-dfff-4347-ad22-72baef552eea}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Ba0c412bd-dfff-4347-ad22-72baef552eea%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Ba0c412bd-dfff-4347-ad22-72baef552eea%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:619abb83-31a0-42fe-a248-af179f545e4d/70585065-37d7-4edc-91aa-597b2bcb1d6f/128"}}, "nickname": "Micho Radovnikovich", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:619abb83-31a0-42fe-a248-af179f545e4d"}, "updated_on": "2020-01-14T02:38:17.372921+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 131487377}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 3097, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/3097.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/3097"}}, "title": "Workaround for road segments in world file not being visible in camera sensor output"}}, {"comment": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/3097/comments/131479951.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/3097/_/diff#comment-131479951"}}, "parent": {"id": 131121038, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/3097/comments/131121038.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/3097/_/diff#comment-131121038"}}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 3097, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/osrf/gazebo/pullrequests/3097.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/osrf/gazebo/pull-requests/3097"}}, "title": "Workaround for road segments in world file not being visible in camera sensor output"}, "content": {"raw": "I made a comment below.
