You can simply solve this by moving the cameras 2cm along positive x. Alternatively you could also shift the setup left or right by a cm such that the cameras are inside the model.\nIncreasing the distance of the near clipping plane for both cameras should also resolve this.\nFor the MultiSense-SL head this won't be an issue as the CAD model for the head will change accordingly.\n\n-Thomas", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Maurice,</p>\n<p>regarding your 7cm baseline issue: the problem is that when changing the setup to 7cm baseline using the current robot head, the cameras are exactly between hokuyo and head wall which causes the cameras to see parts of the wall.
