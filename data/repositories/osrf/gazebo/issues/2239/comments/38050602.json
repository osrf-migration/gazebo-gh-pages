Instead of using two links, I use three links. Suppose that the first link is what you want to revolute in two directions. Add a joint between the second link and the first link, and set it revolute in one direction. Hide the second link if you must. Then add a joint between the second link and the third link, which is the other joint you used to add a revolute2 joint. The result is that the first link can revolute in two axis.\nI made a simple example below.\n![two revolute joint.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/464453152-two_revolute_joint.png)\nAlso I have to mention that revolute2 api have a lot of bugs, for gazebo v7.8.1.
