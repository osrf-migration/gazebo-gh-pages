However, this only supports gazebo9. When I scrolled up the terminal output, I saw an error about not finding a release file for \"eoan\" (so the 19.10 version) and that this is not secure, so it wouldn't be installed or something. then it proceeded to get the dependencies of course and told me it's finished. I assume there is just not a release build for Ubuntu 19.10 in the repo yet?
