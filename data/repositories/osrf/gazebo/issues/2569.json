That happens to be a problem to Gazebo in the sense that we are not able to use the Gazebo tools without having to compile the code from source. Tools like `gztopic -e <topic>` do not work for new custom messages, as reported previously.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: does Gazebo support self-describing messages? Is there any other considerations to take into account besides adding a `FileDescriptorSet` to the message definition? Does it require any change on the Gazebo GUI/tools so to be able to support these?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your feedback!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>It's a well known limitation (or implementation consideration) that Protocol Buffers do not contain descriptions of their own types.
