All of the file browsers were affected.\n\nI was able to track down the root cause to settings in my \".config/Trolltech.conf\".  In particular, having \"style=GTK+\" in Trolltech.conf broke the file browsers.  Removing it fixed the issue.\n\nAs a side note, the Building Editor \"import\" functionality is working fine for me after the configuration changes.\n\nThanks again.  I'm very impressed by how quickly you guys responded to my original comment.
