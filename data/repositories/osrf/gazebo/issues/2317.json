All of my plugins broke. They give this error:\r\n```\r\nconst [with T = gazebo::transport::Connection; \r\ntypename boost::detail::sp_member_access<T>::type = gazebo::transport::Connection*]: \r\nAssertion `px != 0' failed.\r\n```\r\nThat error shows with other data types as well (search the issues list for sp_member_access). Looking into it further, it appears that the Gazebo code is not allocating shared_ptr objects according to the instructions on the Boost library. From what I was reading today, all lines that look like this:\r\n```\r\n#!c++\r\n\r\nblah = ConnectionPtr(new transport::Connection())\r\n```\r\nshould look like this instead:\r\n```\r\n#!c++\r\nblah = boost::make_shared<transport::Connection>()\r\n```\r\nThe boost `make_shared` avoids the above error. It should apply to transport::Node, transport::Connection, and others -- everywhere you have an object that uses `boost::enable_shared_from_this`. I was able to work around the error on Node because that is allocated directly in my plugin. The event connections aren't so easy. I don't know how to override their allocation from my code.\r\n\r\nAgain, my plugins haven't had this problem for long.
