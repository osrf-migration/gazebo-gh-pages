In order for you to fix this on your computer you just need to execute \"export GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI=http://gazebosim.org/models\" after loading the drcsim setup script (e.g. either put it in your command line after sourcing the setup.sh or in your .bashrc if you're already loading the setup script there).\n\nAfter doing so ground_plane and sun should be downloaded to ~/.gazebo/models/ and successfully loaded in gazebo.\n\n@OSRF: if you want DRC users to be independent of their internet connection these files should be added to the DRC or Gazebo package. (independence of a fast internet connection was the reason for unsetting the environment variable I think .. downloading ground_plane or sun does not require a good internet connection though, so I guess you could as well just not unset it?
