I am working with a gazebo plugin called flyingKinect which is basically a kinect that can be teleoperated. The idea is to extract planes from RGBD data while the sensor moves. This already works on static: moving the kinect sensor, waiting one second or so, activating the plane extraction, then stopping it, moving it again, waiting one second, activating it and so on. \n\nAt first I thought that it was a problem in the plugin, so I place some time stamps on the functions that gazebo calls to update the position and the camera in the plugin and, when a kinect camera starts moving, the position is updated sooner than the image, with no way to filter it since it is the exactly same moment. And it only happens sometines.\n\nFor example, in this image we can see a kinect in the middle of a square room and we are viewing it from the top. That plane extraction is the result of extracting them while the sensor spins around:\n\n![GazeboLista1.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/698381806-GazeboLista1.png)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>This problem has also affected my project.
