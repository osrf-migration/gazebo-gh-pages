The physics engine used is the default, ODE.\r\n\r\nThese issues are:\r\n\r\n* When an update rate of 1000 Hz is specified, when the robot is not moving, the FT sensor measures vary from +1N and -1N.\r\n* When specifying lower update rates, after starting the simulation, the sensor readings show a force of 1N in a direction parallel to the floor. If i exert an external force in that direction, the sensor measures the exact force that i have applied, there is no 1N extra. After stopping exerting that force, the sensors indicates no force for several milliseconds, but finally that force of 1N appears again.\r\n* The only way that I have found in order to prevent that force from appearing is moving the robot.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the source of this strange behavior is.
