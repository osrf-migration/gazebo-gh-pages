I have investigated a little bit for this (Spent several days and got frustrated without solutions). \n\nBasically, I found that the dae files provided in the gazebo examples (run.dae, walk.dae etc.) use a special skeleton definition different from CMU MoCap skeleton. In the examples, the bones are actually not connected, as shown in this pic. And all the bones are facing towards.\n\n![pose1.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/1650666650-pose1.png)\n\nBut in the standard skeleton or in BVH files, those bones are defined to be connected to each other (shown here), which means that move one bone will also cause other associated bones to move. However in the example files, move one bone will only cause this bone to move. I guess maybe this is the cause of the distortion,  maybe from the loader. \n\n![pose2.png](data/bitbucket.org/repo/jgXqbo/images/304955533-pose2.png)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks for your quick reply.
