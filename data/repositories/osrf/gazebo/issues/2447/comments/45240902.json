I got inspired from sasabot's code [here](https://github.com/sasabot/hrisys/blob/master/hrisys_gazebo_tutorials/src/bvhactor.cc). \n\nThe point is before retargetting the BVH transformation to the dae file, it is required to do some pre-processing to the BVH transformation. Basically, it is needed to align the bone length, the initial posture, and the initial rotations. Accordingly, I made some changes to the Actor.cc and Actor.hh files. You can find my code here: [Actor.cc](https://github.com/mingfeisun/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Actor.cc) and [Actor.hh](https://github.com/mingfeisun/gazebo/blob/master/gazebo/physics/Actor.hh).
