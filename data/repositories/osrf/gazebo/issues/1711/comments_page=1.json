libogre1.8, leaving gazeob6 to use ogre1.9. I know we talked about releasing gazebo6 on trusty with libogre-18 a couple days ago. Here are my musing since then: \n\nI'm going to be pedantic, so bear with me. ROS behaves kind-of-like a package manager. For each version of ROS, specific versions of other libraries are selected. This is similar to, but no identical to, an operating system like ubuntu. According to Ubuntu, once it is released a new major version of a package can not be included. For example, if gazebo6 is released into ubuntu 15.10, then we can't put gazebo7 into ubuntu 15.10 (some caveats apply). Bringing this back to ROS; jade selected gazebo5 and therefore we shouldn't expect to use gazebo6 with jade. However, a person is free to compile from source.\n\nNow less pedantic. We have gone down the road of releasing gazebo6 debians for jade, so we should make it work. It sounds like the only way to accomplish this is to re-release gazebo6 in trusty with a different dependency (libogre-1.8). This is something that should not be done since it could make another end user very unhappy (for example, an end user that installs gazebo6 on trusty and writes a plugin that needs libogre-1.9).

ROS behaves kind-of-like a package manager. For each version of ROS, specific versions of other libraries are selected. This is similar to, but no identical to, an operating system like ubuntu. According to Ubuntu, once it is released a new major version of a package can not be included. For example, if gazebo6 is released into ubuntu 15.10, then we can't put gazebo7 into ubuntu 15.10 (some caveats apply). Bringing this back to ROS; jade selected gazebo5 and therefore we shouldn't expect to use gazebo6 with jade. However, a person is free to compile from source.</p>\n<p>Now less pedantic.
