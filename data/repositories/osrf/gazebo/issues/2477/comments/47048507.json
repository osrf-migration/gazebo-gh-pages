Ultimately the cause of the spikes in the data is because we're doing velocity control via the joints `SetVelocity` API. This is kinda fighting physics since the physics really want force commands, and so whatever is happening under the hood with Gazebo/ODE when we make the `SetVelocity` call is causing the spikes in the joint velocities and force/torque sensors. If I comment out our calls to that function then the data is smooth and we don't have the spikes. Either this points to a bug in the gazebo code or to the fact that trying to set a joints velocity directly and subverting physics isn't good to do.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I believe we have figured out why this is happening, though we don't have a solution necessarily without subverting the gazebo API.
