So, this must be a VMWare  OpenGL 2.1 quirk. I dont understand why the wide angle camera lens shader appears to work, but the depth sensor point cloud does not. Having seen what the cloud now looks like, I agree with your earlier comments about the frame convention. My opinion would be that the resulting frame of the point cloud should match that produced by the gazebo_ros_pkgs depth camera plugin for compatibility reasons.
