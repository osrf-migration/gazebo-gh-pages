I am aware that I am reading this years later. But I'm also trying to figure out an issue in my own simulation regarding a force torque sensor (that i did not develop. Please see link to package repo below). My issue involved a noisy signal when the sensor is in contact with an object. I have already raised this issue on github on the sensor repo. The noise is a fluctuation between a magnitude force reading and zero. I'm assuming this isn't the same error, but I just wanted to make sure that gazebo is indeed simulating collisions properly.\n\nhttps://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/force-torque-sensor", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Is there a solution to this issue?
