Would it be too much trouble if you made a full arrow, a bit larger than the other 3, so it actually hides the other ones when overlapping?\n\n* It would also be awesome to have the different visuals according to joint type, but maybe that's asking too much? hehe", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Cool :) As Steven said, there has been a lot of discussion about the joint visuals for gzweb which can also apply to gzclient.
