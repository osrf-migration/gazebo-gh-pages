Closing the gzclient would cause it to revert to the slower speed.\" \n@scpeters I noticed this behavior as well on both Gazebo 7 with island threads and without the threads. It [seems](#!/osrf/gazebo/issues/2316/pausing-the-physics-in-sensors-onupdate) that in the headless mode when I SetPause the world from a sensor the pause can take a couple of seconds (I saw it going all the way up to 4 seconds simulation time) which breaks the sensor update. On the other hand, this is not the case when gzclient is running. Did you manage to find a proper fix for this?
