Noise Density * dt = Variance, so the effect is that if the current gazebo sensors are over sampled, you will be able to achieve more accuracy than actually possible form the sensor and if you under sample, you will have less accuracy, so this probably is better how it is handled in rotors. The issue is that the current parameters all ask for standard deviation, so what you prefer for the new model, standard deviation or noise density. I want to be able to support noise density curently. I could just have the GAUSSIAN_WALK model use noise density and leave the GAUSSIAN model as is. That is probably the most straight forward, but not consistent.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>There is also a difference in how noise is handled. rotors currently uses  noise density.
