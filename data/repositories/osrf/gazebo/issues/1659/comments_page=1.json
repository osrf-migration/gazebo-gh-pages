The simulation rates should be at least double arcucopter controller rates for reasonable simulation.

You could try rerun the test with large number of inner iterations (iters ~O(1e3)) or use generalized coordinate engine like simbody or dart (or bullet3) and see if that helps.

Can someone provide/suggest a simplified world with a scenario that reproduces the instability?\n\nImproving the plugin to model twisted blade geometry and account for different velocity at different radii will be great. The current implementation is a proof of concept plugin (i.e. dead-simple order of magnitude simulation), I was as surprised to see that the ardupilot controller can maintain stable flight as well as reproduce reasonable looking flight dynamics without the need for crazy aerodynamic coefficients :-) But now that the basic plugin approach works, it is a good time to plan on making improvements to the aerodynamic calculations, as well as adding more unit tests and documentation.\n\nMost of the time, simulation development is driven by application needs.
