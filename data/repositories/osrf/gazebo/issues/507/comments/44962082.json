This is a major problem.  I'm a grad student in a robotics lab and we're trying to run long-term, many-episode robot learning experiments using Gazebo and ROS.  This is made very inconvenient by the fact that occasionally our robot's limbs fall off during an episode, and using reset_world puts the robot's body back at the origin but doesn't put its arms back on.  Reset_simulator isn't an option because it causes various other ROS modules to crash, complaining that ROS time went backwards.  The only option is for us to kill the entire gazebo-and-ROS-and-learning-agent system and restart from the last checkpoint - meaning we have to periodically check the robot's state visually (making running in headless mode impractical) and then manually reset the entire system.\n\nIt is, frankly, astonishing that such a basic feature isn't implemented.  I can't imagine that wanting to completely reset a robot's pose without restarting all of ROS is a rare use case, nor can I imagine that this would be difficult to implement.  If changing the behaviour of reset_world is a problem for compatibility reasons, couldn't another call, \"full_reset_world\" or something, be implemented?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I just wanted to chime in and say that this issue is still present in Gazebo 8.
