I've specified the orientation as [0, PI/2, -PI/4], which should align the body with the line y = -x, but that's not what I see when I load the model.  However, if I truncate the pitch angle by a few decimal places, the resulting orientation is correct.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a minor issue, as it doesn't crop up unless I specify PI/2 to 15 or 16 decimal places.
