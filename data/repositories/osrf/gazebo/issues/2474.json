I am using kinect right now. I tried the way spawned kinect, deleted it and respawned it every time and the way that firstly spawned kinect and just use rosservice set model state to change model pose. The problem of the first way is after I deleted the kinect and respawned it, the images I got are all grey but the first one is normal. I am assuming the pose of camera is pointing at somewhere else. The second way also doesn't work since the pose of camera didn't change with the model. Even the visual model changed its pose, camera still get the same image. \r\nThanks in advance for any help.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>Basically I want to recording some datasets for taking pics with different camera poses for different objects with different poses.
