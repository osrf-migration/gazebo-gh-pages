This results in a large inertia ratio across the joints, which is problematic in Gazebo with the default settings. I increased it's mass and MOI values by a factor of 10 and it was stable with step size of 0.001. Take a look at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=preset_manager&cat=physics to learn more about this issue.
