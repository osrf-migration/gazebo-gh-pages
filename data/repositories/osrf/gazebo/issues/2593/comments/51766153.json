I gave 8 of them 100 times more mass and the rest 10 times more mass.\nThe model is now more or less stable with a time step of 0.0005. And half of the real time speed is acceptable for my purpose.\nBut after between 1 and 10 minutes the model still crashes, but 1 minute is long enough for my experiments, so I can work with that.\n\nI used this construct to e.g. create a shoulder with 3 degrees of freedom. Is there another way of creating a flexible shoulder/elbow/wrist without the stability issues?\nThanks again, Sietse", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thank you very much for the reply, and sorry for the late response!\nI came here after getting no answers from gazebo/answers.</p>\n<p>In my complete model there were 12 of those light links.
