In VMWare we used the driver provided by VMWare.  \n\nWe can try running it on a physical Ubuntu machine, but ultimately this will be a problem for high performance computing since we deploy everything as Docker containers onto Amazon Web Services machines.\n\nAs @drdanz noticed, we don't see this all the time.  We see it in approximately half of our runs, where a single run consists of starting up Gazebo a single time.
