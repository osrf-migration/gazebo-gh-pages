As you can see in the attached image circle 1 seems to be the center of the drawn scan while circle 2 is the assumed center used for drawing measurements (circle 3 can be ignored I guess as you're not considering the offset of optical center to base).\r\n\r\n(this is both in default and laser_vis_fix)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The range readings shown by the laser viewer seems to either have some constant offset or some bug in how it obtains distances in general.
