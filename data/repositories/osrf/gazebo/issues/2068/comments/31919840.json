However, Steven, I used that world for a while, and I recall clearly being able to get what felt like a 'wrong' result.  That is, if I recall right, it has gravity in x and z, and the friction behaves as expected.  If you shift the gravity to y and z, though, you get a behavior that felt wrong. I specifically recall thinking that it did prove that fdir was in world coordinates, not object relative coordinates.  If I was less lame, I'd retest with Andrea's patch and see if that makes it behave more as I would expect.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Forgive me; this is going to be one of those utterly useless comments, because I don't have the time to investigate and comment in detail.
