I'm suspecting this is because of the different transport but I can't really prove it. I am running gzserver and gzclient on different machines over the LAN, I don't know whether the same effect happens if they run on the same machine.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Another issue caused by sending markers over a different transport than the rendering and that I had not seen initially is that the markers lag behind the animation.
