An example would be to run gzserver in the cloud and gzclient on a local laptop. In such a situation, you can set GAZEBO_MASTER_URI all you want on the laptop, it will not give you ignition transport connectivity and thus markers set, for example, in a model plugin in gzserver will not show up in gzclient on your laptop.\n\nAs a sample use-case, I'm developing a rather complex simulation of boats on a non-flat ocean surface. I'd like to run this (basically headless) on many servers in the cloud to run many simulations. But I also want to be able to remotely connect to such a server and visualize the physics using markers for troubleshooting purposes. For example, the markers can show the force on each mesh triangle, or show the submerged part of the mesh, etc.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Shane, the two questions referred-to by Louise should answer your questions, but in short, if gzserver and gzclient are not in the same UDP multicast domain then ignition transport does not \"connect\".
