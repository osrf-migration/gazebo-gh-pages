The fix in pull request #2702 may be related, but it looks like there hasn't been a release yet. Try [installing from source](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_from_source&cat=install) and checking if it's still an issue. When it's released, [install from packages.osrfoundation.org](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install) to get a more recent version of gazebo 7 than `7.0`.\n\nI notice the `<collision>` elements are using `<mesh>` geometry. In general mesh on mesh collisions should be avoided. An easy way to ensure this is to only use `<mesh>` geometry on `<collision>` on static objects. Anything else should be approximated with simple shapes.\n\nThe good news for your robot is it looks easy to approximate with simple shapes without compromising on the overall shape. The tall body could be a cylinder shape. The ball on the bottom could be a sphere. The rollers connecting the balls could also be cylinders.\n\nIf this resolves the issue but you have more questions, please raise them on http://answers.gazebosim.org/questions/", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>That's a cool looking robot!
