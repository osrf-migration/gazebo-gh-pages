A modelling of the omni wheels like you did however does not work for me especially when implementing a controller: I just tried to drive in one direction without the ball and the 3omni wheel robot behaves very strange: If I set the mu1 to 0 and the mu2 to 0.2 for instance I can drive in the 90 degree and - 90 degree direction. But not in any other direction. If I set the mu1 to 0.2 and the mu1 to 0 I can drive in the 180 and 0\u00b0 degree direction and not in any other regardless of what the fdir1 parameter was set. Has anyone successfully implemented a controller for this robot?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hey there thanks a lot for sharing.
