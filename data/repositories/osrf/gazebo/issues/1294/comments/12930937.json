However, strictly speaking, a magnetometer shouldn't fall under the category 'inertial', as it measures only extrinsic forces, whereas IMUs measure intrinsic forces. Collectively, I believe a magnetometer and IMU are bundled into a motion processing unit (MPU), which provides derived values like orientation.\n\nAs Silvio mentioned, there are often cases -- particularly when energy is  constrained -- where a standalone accelerometer is used. I guess what I am saying, is that IMUs and MPUs are metasensor packages, with magnetometers, gyroscopes and accelerometers being the actual sensors.\n\nAgain, maybe a bit pedantic. But, it may be useful to make design decisions that give rise to a logical division between a base sensor and sensor bundles.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I agree with Silvio.
