In addition to perhaps being slightly simpler to add, the only distinct advantage that I can see with bundling sensors into these units is the ability to write a SensorPlugin that synthetically generates correlated error perturbations. \n\nThis invites an even larger discussion about how spatiotemporal (integral to GNSS performance), temperature (sometimes integral to IMU) and pressure (integral to altimeters) correlated errors should be dealt with in Gazebo.
