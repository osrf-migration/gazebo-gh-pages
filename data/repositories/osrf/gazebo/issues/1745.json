I haven't tried with Gazebo6 from .debs yet.\r\n\r\nI have a robot model that has an empty base_link (no geometry, inertial properties or visuals), see [model here](https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/taurob_tracker_common/blob/master/taurob_tracker_description/urdf/tracker_chassis.urdf.xacro.xml#L16). When I try to make this model slide around in an empty world (by applying forces), I get lots of contacts between base_link and the ground plane. Given that no geometry has been specified for base_link, this should not happen.\r\n\r\nSee [video](https://youtu.be/jkghH2CvkoE). I set the chassis link to be frictionless, but not the base_link. This apparently causes the issues observed in the video, as the base_link contacts have default friction parameters, resulting in non-sliding behavior. Once I set the \"no friction\" params for base_link, too, the model slides over the ground as expected.\r\n\r\nIt appears that due to the fixed joint between both links, both get lumped into one gazebo link. It is counter-intuitive that the empty base_link apparently inherits the chassis_link's collision geometry, but keeps the default friction parameters.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior expected or will this be changed?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>This is running 14.04/ROS Indigo/Gazebo4 (from drcsim with .debs).
