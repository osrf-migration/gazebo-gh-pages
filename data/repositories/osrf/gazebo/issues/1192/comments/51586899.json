Also I wouldn't try to compile it as I made lots of hacks to the cmake files to be able to build and run it side by side with the standard gazebo versions (my requirements at the time).\n\nHowever, the main commit that might be useful is https://bitbucket.org/daveraja/gazebo-old/commits/54005ab2743535d1044d5991b9ea5176df92f8f6\n\nIn particular, I created a new sensor ``ObjectCamera`` by basically duplicating ``DepthCamera``; so, adding a ``gazebo::rendering::ObjectCamera`` and ``gazebo::sensor::ObjectCameraSensor`` etc.\n\nThe code that replaces the model's material with a custom colour is in ``gazebo::rendering::ObjectUtil.[hh|cc]``.
