In 12.04 we are using libogre-dev yes, which brings ogre 1.7.* series which is perfectly fine to run and compile gazebo. We should fix the tutorial.\n\n2. In 13.04 both, ogre-1.7 (libogre-dev) or ogre-1.8 (libogre-1.8-dev) could be used. libogre-1.8-dev conflicts with raring version of libogre-dev so you can not have both versions at the same time if using packages. If you want to use cegui (optional), libcegui-mk2-0.7.6 depends on libogre-1.7.4 so it can not be installed together with libogre-1.8-dev but libogre-dev.
