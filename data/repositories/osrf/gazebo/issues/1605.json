Can anyone please tell me how to do that ?? Also , I don't want to use ROS and Plugin methods. I just want to write a C or C++ code for that.  \r\n\r\n2) After receiving the speed, I now want to set the speed of that joint according to me by the same method as mentioned above i.e. by writing C or C++ API code, without using ROS and Plugin methods.\r\n\r\nI would be really grateful to you if you help me out with this .", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi everyone !</p>\n<p>1) I have made a small robot model with 4 wheels.
