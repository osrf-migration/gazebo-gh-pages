When you set the hand brake to 0, gas pedal to 1, and then gradually set the steering angle from 0 to 2 to 2.5 to 3 to 3.14 everything seems to be fine. But when you go from 0 directly to 3 the car completely stops every few meters. When using a lower gas the \"step size\" that it stops working at is even lower (e.g. for 0.5 gas it stops working with a 0 -> 2 transition already I think).\r\n\r\nThis problem does not seem to exist on the golf cart model (the golf cart however does not seem to be able to regulate the gas strength though). I thought it might be related to the friction coefficients the polaris model's wheels have which are missing on the golf cart but even after removing them the same problem persisted. \r\n\r\nThis bug also occurs when you have to stop the vehicle while driving at a \"high\" steering angle and then try to continue driving. You have to go back to 0 steering angle (or somewhere close to maybe, haven't verified whether it has to be exactly 0) in order to recover normal car behaviour.\r\n\r\nVideo demonstrating the bug (you can see the steering commands sent at the top): http://youtu.be/GLBSdJKZD0I\r\n\r\nSame steering command (0 -> 3.14 transition) with golf cart: http://youtu.be/K2Y02CdGP0I", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>There seems to be a bug with the polaris ranger related to steering angle and the vehicle's velocity (or possibly it's a gazebo bug triggered by polaris).
