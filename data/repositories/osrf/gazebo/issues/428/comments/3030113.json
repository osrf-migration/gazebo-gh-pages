If you want normals on both sides of a flat geometry you'll have to create two faces facing in opposite direction (which you can then call double sided normals I guess). For the mailbox flag and stop-sign pole you only have faces facing in one direction so you only have one side textured. For having both sides textured one solution is to disable culling [1] either via material or software or create faces for the other side of the pole and flag. The problem you have with disabling culling is that you'll get a lot of z-fighting for parts in the model that are flat geometry as well but do have two sided faces (e.g. the hexagonal part of the stop sign).\n\n[1] http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=-material#Both-side_visibility", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but afaik there's no such thing as double sided normals.
