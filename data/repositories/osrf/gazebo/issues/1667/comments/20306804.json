In this case, the Altimeter wouldn't measure \"elevation\". This seems like an edge case. The advantage of the current implementation is simplicity, which makes it less prone to implementation errors. As such, I am fine with keeping the current implementation until users express an interest. So please comment on this issue and vote for it if you really want the AltimeterSensor output to be more general.\n\nRegarding the questions:\n\n1. We can add support for this if users request it. Though some users might modify gravity to simulate disturbances, which would interfere with the AltimeterSensor.\n\n2. We can enable this as well if (1) is implemented. Though again, some users might disable gravity during testing, which would also interfere with the AltimeterSensor.\n\n3. This seems like an edge case as well and is probably more suited for a SensorPlugin.\n\n@asymingt ", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I think the most likely issue users would have is if they are simulating a drone with gravity defined along the X or Y axes.
