The problem is that everything seems good until it grasps the object. Once the object is grasped, when the arm is doing some kind of motion, then the gripper links tend to open and close during the motion, thereby releasing the grasp object. I tried may ways thinking its a controller issue, by tuning the PID, increasing the mass, collision mesh and many more. The end results are almost same, no improvement in any case.  Even the grasp hack which has been used earlier has also been tested, but still no use. The same configuration of the robot worked fine in gazebo version 2.2.3. Any idea how to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n![gripper info during grasping](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RLq61-UqOZ8jmcHtv6eaKSASOXrXg9Z919dYYxY-lncFHpvZimGzkK3qCCy2VAByDgZOFy-pj_tYUayLAFR3VTa5Kj1Bq-JihsVVelqZ)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I have been facing issue with my robot after grasping an object.
